# Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest
This project aims to predict the price of gold using historical data and the Random Forest algorithm. 

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from [source]. It contains historical data of gold prices and other relevant financial indicators.

# Technologies Used
Python Streamlit scikit-learn

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA has been conducted to explore the dataset. This includes analyzing the distribution of gold prices, identifying outliers, and understanding the relationships between different features.

# Random Forest Model
The Random Forest algorithm has been used to train the machine learning model for gold price prediction. The Random Forest algorithm is a powerful ensemble learning method used for regression tasks.

# Evaluation
The model is evaluated using R-squared score.
R Squared Error: 0.9892091367803421.
The evaluation results help in understanding the performance of the model.

# Results
The final model provides predictions for gold prices with a certain accuracy. The results are visualized using plots and graphs to show the actual vs. predicted prices.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or suggestions, feel free to open a pull request or create an issue.

# Deployment
The application is deployed using Streamlit. You can access it here = https://ml-project-8-gold-price-prediction-s7ye4yjuuzal5idhfppksf.streamlit.app/
